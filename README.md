# Warm-Of-Space
It is the first game project I did in my first internship
<p>2 dimensional game contains 8 levels in total. </p>
<li> Screen boundaries are calculated based on camera boundaries. <li/>
<li> Player can move right, left, up and down. <li/>
<li> Player cannot go off stage.  <li/>
<li> Asteroids move from left to right randomly from the point I set outside the scene.  <li/>
<li>Each time the player hits a stone, player earns one point.<li/>
<li>As the level progresses, enemy spaceships have been added to the game.<li/>
The player tries to hit this fire without touching it. 
<p>Free products in the asset store were used for game design </p>
